# Blackjack project

The goal of this project is to build out a blackjack game with frontends and backend APIs as I continue to grow and learn.  

### Note:
This project has been put on hold as the models were to complicated to quickly move to different technologies. Please see the [ToDo app](https://github.com/wley3337/ToDo-Project) for the project I'm working on atm. 

# Frontends:

* [React with hooks](https://github.com/wley3337/blackjack-react-hooks)


# Backends: 

* [Rails API PostgresSQL](https://github.com/wley3337/blackjack-rails-api)
